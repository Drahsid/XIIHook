# Welcome Back
The program now works with 1.0.3! However, for the best experience you still may want to use 1.0.2. The program is currently missing many of the previously implemented features. The most popular ones work though!
Please report any bugs for these new builds!

# FFXIITZA-FPS-Unlocker
This mod allows for you to unlock the full potential of your system and to run Final Fantasy XII at whatever framerate you desire! This also comes with some other goodies, such as the ability to modify the in-game multiplier variables to anything, focus-based framerate scaling, and more!

## Features

### Free Camera
Pressing CTRL will allow you to detach the camera from the party and explore the world of the game at your own will!

### Unlocking your potential
Get framerates as high as your system can produce. This program gives you full control over the in-game framerate- you could even lower it if that's your style.

### Control the in-game multiplier
Is 4x speed not enough? Make it 24x! Want to punish yourself for trying to use the in-game multiplier? Set the values 1! Whatever you want, you have complete control.

### Control what you see
Feel a bit claustrophobic with the game's low field of view? Fear not! You can change it to whatever you like- you could even lower it if you want a good closeup.

#### Change the Gamma
Alongside the field of view customization, you can also modify the game's gamma!

### Keep your resources
Tab out of the game to go reply to a pesky email and find that it's hogging all of your computer's resources? No longer! You can tone the game down when it's your current focus.

### Relative input scaling
The program offers multiple options for how you want your mouse or controller input to scale based on the in-game multiplier. You can even change a base value to make it faster or slower overall!

### Other goodies
There are many other small options and tweaks in this program relating to the user experience and some possible optimizations.
